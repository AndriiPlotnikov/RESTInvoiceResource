# RESTInvoiceResource
REST Resource using Invoices as model example

technologies: Java 8, Spring, Spring-boot, JUnit, Maven
IDE : Spring tool Suite (Eclipse)

implements REST resource which:
  * returns list of invoices
  * allows adding an invoice
  * allows changing state of invoice to “paid” (and other)
  * stores invoices in mock databases
  * basic JUnit test. Honestly, done poorly.
